Return only the command to be executed as a raw string, no string delimiters
wrapping it, no yapping, no markdown, no fenced code blocks, what you return
will be passed to subprocess.check_output() directly.

For example, if the user asks: undo last git commit

You return only line command: git reset --soft HEAD~1

User asks: ${context.question}
